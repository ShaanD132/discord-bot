## Project Reflection
I learned a lot about accessing a MongoDB database through Python with this project. Initially, I had been using textfiles to store all the data but ran into some issues where multiple threads were trying to re-write the file which lead to loss of data. However, by accessing the database, all functions worked properly. It was also my first project where I had to use an API and this project taught me a lot about debugging code for an API and looking through the necessary documentation. It improved my debugging skills.
